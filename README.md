## Admin Management System

The application now includes comprehensive admin management capabilities with **hardcoded permissions in the User model**:

### Admin Features
- **Admin Dashboard**: System overview with real-time statistics, user distribution, and health monitoring
- **Permission Management**: Granular permission system hardcoded into the User model for:
    - `manage_users`: User account management
    - `manage_jobs`: Job posting oversight  
    - `manage_applications`: Application review
    - `view_reports`: System analytics access
    - `system_settings`: Configuration management
- **Admin Creation**: Secure interface for existing admins to create new administrators
- **Security Features**: Role-based access control, input validation, and secure session management

### Creating Your First Admin

**Option 1: Quick Admin Creation Script**
```python
# Create initial admin user
from app import create_app
from app.models import db, User

app = create_app()
with app.app_context():
        admin = User.query.filter_by(username='admin').first()
        if not admin:
                admin = User(
                        username='admin',
                        email='admin@jobboard.com', 
                        password='admin123',  # Change this!
                        role='admin'
                )
                db.session.add(admin)
                db.session.commit()
                print("Admin created: admin / admin123")
```

**Option 2: Register as Admin**
1. Register a normal account through `/register`
2. Manually update the database to change role to 'admin'
3. The permission system will automatically activate

### Admin Permissions Integration

The admin system is **fully integrated into the User model** with these benefits:

âœ… **No Migration Scripts**: SQLAlchemy handles schema automatically  
âœ… **Integrated Security**: Permissions are part of the core user system  
âœ… **Simple Deployment**: No separate database migration files  
âœ… **Backward Compatible**: Existing users work without changes  
âœ… **JSON Permissions**: Flexible permission storage in text field  

### Admin Routes

- `/admin/dashboard` - System overview and statistics
- `/admin/create-admin` - Create new admin users (admin only)
- Permission checking integrated throughout the application

See the [detailed documentation](docs/detailed_explanation.md#admin-dashboard-and-permission-management) for complete admin system specifications, security implementation details, and permission management information.

## Dashboard Features

The application includes comprehensive role-based dashboards that provide personalized user experiences:

- **Job Seeker Dashboard**: Track application status, view applied jobs, and access quick actions for job searching
- **Employer Dashboard**: Manage job postings, review applications, and monitor hiring metrics  
- **Admin Dashboard**: System-wide overview with user management, job oversight, and platform statistics

Each dashboard is tailored to specific user roles with appropriate access controls and relevant data visualization. Dashboards feature responsive design, interactive components, and real-time status tracking.

See the [detailed documentation](docs/detailed_explanation.md#dashboard-features) for complete dashboard specifications, access control details, and implementation information.

## Authentication System

The application includes a comprehensive authentication system featuring:
- **Secure Registration**: User registration with password hashing and validation
- **Session Management**: Flask sessions with configurable timeouts and "remember me" functionality
- **Role-Based Access**: Differentiated access for job seekers and employers
- **Password Security**: Werkzeug password hashing with salt generation
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with comprehensive error handling
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Context-aware navigation based on authentication status

Users can register as either job seekers or employers, with the interface adapting to their role. The system includes comprehensive form validation, secure password handling, and persistent sessions.

See the [detailed documentation](docs/detailed_explanation.md#authentication-system) for complete authentication specifications and security details.

## User Interface

The application features a modern, responsive user interface with:
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Bootstrap 5
- **Interactive Components**: Animated statistics, hover effects, and smooth transitions
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with visual feedback and error handling
- **Loading States**: User-friendly loading indicators and progress feedback
- **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant design with keyboard navigation and screen reader support

See the [detailed documentation](docs/detailed_explanation.md#user-interface-design) for complete UI specifications and design system details.

## Routes

The application includes the following main routes:
- **Homepage** (`/`) - Welcome page with platform overview and animated statistics
- **Job Listings** (`/jobs`) - Browse and search job postings with advanced filtering
- **Authentication** (`/login`, `/register`, `/logout`) - User authentication and session management
- **About** (`/about`) - Platform information and mission

See the [detailed documentation](docs/detailed_explanation.md#routes-and-templates) for complete route specifications and template details.

## Database Migration

The application has been **migrated from MySQL to SQLite3** for improved simplicity and portability:

### Benefits of SQLite3
- âœ… **No Server Setup**: File-based database with no separate server required
- âœ… **Portability**: Easy database file backup and migration
- âœ… **Development Friendly**: Perfect for development and testing
- âœ… **Cross-platform**: Consistent behavior across all platforms
- âœ… **ACID Compliance**: Full transaction support and data integrity

### Migration Details
- All existing models and relationships remain fully compatible
- Database file located at: `job_board.db` in project root
- Configuration updated in `config/db_config.py`
- No changes required to existing SQLAlchemy queries

See the [detailed documentation](docs/detailed_explanation.md#profile-management-system) for complete profile management specifications and SQLite3 migration details.

## Database Models

The application uses three main models with **SQLite3 database**:
- **User**: Enhanced with profile fields (full_name, phone, location, bio) and profile management methods
- **JobPosting**: Manages job listings with detailed information
- **Application**: Tracks job applications and their status

All models include comprehensive methods for profile management, dashboard data retrieval, and secure database operations.

See the [detailed documentation](docs/detailed_explanation.md#database-models) for complete model specifications and relationships.
